### Routes
```php
// Admin event routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->prefix('admin')->name('admin.')->group(function () {
    Route::resource('events', AdminEventController::class);
    Route::post('/events/{event}/duplicate', [AdminEventController::class, 'duplicate'])->name('events.duplicate');
    Route::post('/events/{event}/export-attendees', [AdminEventController::class, 'exportAttendees'])->name('events.export-attendees');
    Route::post('/events/{event}/export-checkins', [AdminEventController::class, 'exportCheckInReport'])->name('events.export-checkins');
    Route::post('/events/bulk-action', [AdminEventController::class, 'bulkAction'])->name('events.bulk-action');
});
```
